## Overview
This is a blog platform that displays blog data and allows users to create new blog entries that the app will format for easy insertion into the JSON file.

## Getting Started
To run this, you will want to run npm install from the allisa-neth folder. Once your dependancies are installed, run the server.js and view the app in your browser.

## Architecture
This app runs on Node.js and Express on the backend. The front end uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Handlebars.js.

## Credits and Collaborations
This app uses a few npm modules including Express.js, so thanks to all the folks who make that possible!
This code also uses Handlebars for templating and jQuery for ajax requests.
