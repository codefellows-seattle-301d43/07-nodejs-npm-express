# 07-nodejs-npm-express

**Author**: Christina Gislason & Danul De Leon </br>
**Version**: 1.1.1 

## Overview
We built out a server.js file using Express that replaced the previous functionality we have been getting from live-server up to this point. We now used nodemon, Node.js, and Express in order to navigate through the app.

## Getting Started
First, we initialized the project with npm init and installed Express.js.</br>
Second, we instantiated the ExpressJS framework and ensured the server was listening.</br>
Last, we created a route and callback to display the new.html page.

## Architecture
We used HTML, CSS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and npm.

## Change Log

09-12-2018 10:30am - Added new route and callback to display new.html page.
